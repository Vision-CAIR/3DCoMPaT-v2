## 📰 News

- **19/08/2023**: As our CVPR23 challenge has finished (congratulations to [Cattalyya Nuengsikapian](https://3dcompat-dataset.org/workshop/#main-section)!), our test set has now been made public. Dataloaders have been updated in consequence: using the "`EvalLoader`" classes is not necessary anymore 😊

- **18/06/2023**: The 3DCoMPaT++ CVPR23 challenge has been concluded. We would like to congratulate [Cattalyya Nuengsikapian](https://3dcompat-dataset.org/workshop/#main-section), winner of both **coarse** and **fine-grained** tracks for her excellent performance in our challenge 🎉

## 📚 Introduction

3DCoMPaT++ is a multimodal 2D/3D dataset of 16 million rendered views of more than 10 million stylized 3D shapes carefully annotated at **part-instance** level, alongside matching **RGB pointclouds**, **3D textured meshes**, **depth maps** and **segmentation masks**. This work builds upon [3DCoMPaT](https://3dcompat-dataset.org/), the first version of this dataset.

**We plan to further extend the dataset: stay tuned!** 🔥
